## What “pay it forward” means here

Sharing hard‑won lessons so the next person ships faster and with fewer surprises. This site is about practical patterns you can copy, adapt, and pass along.

- Real code and real trade‑offs
- Tiny, reusable patterns over theory
- Credit and gratitude where it’s due

## Ways to contribute

- Mentor someone (pair for an hour; open office hours; code review)  
- Share a post or snippet with a colleague or your team  
- Open an issue or PR on an OSS repo you use  
- Teach a pattern at work; document it and link back here if helpful  
- Suggest a topic you want to see covered

## The pledge

I will share what I learn, lift others as I go, and give credit generously.  
If this helped you, consider paying it forward: teach, share, or contribute.

## Community shout‑outs

A few people and projects I’ve learned from and recommend:
- Rails, Hotwire, and the community around pragmatic Rails
- GraphQL ecosystem: graphql‑ruby, Apollo Client, Codegen
- TypeScript maintainers and educators
- Open‑source authors whose work I build on daily
