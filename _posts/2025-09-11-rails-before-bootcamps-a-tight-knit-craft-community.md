When folks talk about early Rails, they usually talk about the code. What I remember most are the people, the voices, and the quirky ways we learned.

Before bootcamps, learning Rails was not a tidy curriculum. No week by week syllabus, no Slack mentor on call, and not nearly enough tutorials to match every error message. You pieced it together from generous pioneers who shared what they knew in creative, sometimes eccentric ways.

It was messy. It was fun. And it shaped a generation of Rails developers.
I mostly lived on the ruby-talk and rubyonrails-talk mailing lists, and I kept an IRC window open in #rubyonrails on Freenode. Stack Overflow launched in 2008 and quickly became part of the toolbox, but in those early years the best Rails answers were often still in blogs, the lists, or IRC logs.

## RailsCasts: mentorship at scale

If you were learning Rails in the late 2000s or early 2010s, you probably watched Ryan Bates’ RailsCasts.

Every week, Ryan shipped a short screencast on a gem, a pattern, or a tricky concept. Not flashy. Always practical. I used to pause every thirty seconds to copy code, then rewind when I missed a step. He made hard things feel doable. He was not just teaching features. He was teaching how to think in Rails.

RailsCasts stopped updating in 2013, but the library still feels like a shelf of well worn textbooks.

## \_why the lucky stiff: the poet of Ruby

Rails also had its artists. None more famous, or infamous, than \_why the lucky stiff.

\_why was not about best practices. He was about joy. Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby was whimsical and surreal, with cartoon foxes and side trips that somehow made Ruby feel human. It was less a manual and more a love letter to programming.

His sudden disappearance in 2009 left a hole. The spirit stuck around. Rubyists still value expressiveness and fun in large part because of voices like his.

## Rails for Zombies: learning could be playful

Not long after, Code School (before it became Pluralsight) launched Rails for Zombies, an interactive way to learn Rails in the browser.

Instead of dry docs, you solved small challenges to help animated zombies finish tasks. It was playful and accessible. It hinted at what was coming next: Rails education that anyone could reach, not just people willing to dig through mailing lists and source.

---

## What this era felt like

Taken together, RailsCasts, \_why, and Rails for Zombies capture the vibe of the pre bootcamp era:

- DIY learning: you stitched together blogs, screencasts, and mailing lists.
- Personal mentorship: help often came from a single voice, not a company curriculum.
- Culture and quirk: the learning was full of personality and play, not sterile checklists.

It felt like a small club where people knew each other’s names. The flip side: access was uneven. If you never found RailsCasts, or if \_why’s style did not click, the learning curve could be rough.

---

## What we carry forward

Looking back, two lessons stand out for me:

1. Learning is cultural as much as technical. The community thrived because voices like Ryan Bates and \_why made knowledge stick.
2. Accessibility matters. Rails for Zombies proved that playful, approachable learning could open doors. Bootcamps later took that idea to scale.

## Closing thought

Rails back then was small, quirky, and not always easy to enter. It was also a place where creativity, mentorship, and community shone through individual voices.

If you learned through RailsCasts, \_why, or Rails for Zombies, what do you remember most? What do you think today’s newcomers miss without those touchstones?
