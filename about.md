## About me

I'm Bob Roberts, a Senior Software Engineer based in Madison, Wisconsin. I have 15+ years of hands‑on experience building web applications, primarily with Ruby on Rails, for startups, companies, and leading brands. I've worked both in‑house and remotely, on small squads and large programs, often stepping up to lead when the team needs it.

## What I do

- Ruby on Rails product development end to end
- From early discovery and planning through implementation and iteration
- Team leadership and mentoring; calm under pressure; "no task too small"
- Clear communication with stakeholders to turn requests into working software

## How I work

- I focus on business value: clear outcomes, measurable impact, and maintainable code.
- I enjoy the full SDLC: planning, architecture, implementation, reviews, and rollout.
- I prefer pragmatic patterns that teams can own and extend.

## Service and community

- U.S. Army veteran. I learned to be both a humble follower and an effective leader, to communicate clearly, and to perform under pressure.
- Volunteer mentor with Operation Code, helping veterans and families learn to code.
- Organizer and facilitator for local programming meetups over the years.

## Outside of work

- Riding my motorcycle, watching football, and spending time with my wife, daughter, and grand‑kitties.
