Before bootcamps, people found Rails through blog posts, IRC, Ruby user groups, and a handful of excellent screencasts. Learning felt slower, but the community built deep habits around reading code, understanding tradeoffs, and paying it forward.

Here is what that looked like, and what we can bring forward today.

---

## Screencasts and learn-by-building

- RailsCasts (Ryan Bates) — short, focused episodes that taught real techniques and encouraged exploration. You did not just copy code; you learned to reason about Rails.
- PeepCode (Geoffrey Grosenbach) — deeper dives and production minded walkthroughs.

These were not just tutorials; they modeled how to think.

---

## Writing and whimsy

- Why the Lucky Stiff’s "Poignant Guide" taught thousands of us Ruby not by specs, but by story.
- Blog posts were fewer but deeper; comments often had as much value as the posts.

It was normal to read source, diff changes, and talk about why a pattern worked.

---

## Community channels

- Ruby meetups and conferences (like MountainWest RubyConf) created dense "hallway track" learning.
- IRC, mailing lists, and early forums were where you went when docs fell short.

The cadence was slower; the signal was higher.

## What changed with bootcamps

Bootcamps opened the door for more people (a good thing). The rhythm shifted to fast starts and quick wins, which is great for shipping, but sometimes thinner on the fundamentals unless teams intentionally backfill.

In my projects, that gap shows up when a change works but is hard to explain or hard to maintain. The fix is not “go slow.” It is to borrow the old habits: read more source, write deeper docs, and pair more.

---

## Bringing the best of both worlds forward

- Keep the energy and accessibility of modern learning.
- Reintroduce the craft: explain why, not just how.
- Make mentorship part of the job, not an afterthought.

Rails has always been about developer happiness. The thing that sustains that is community.

If you have your own stories from that era, I would love to collect them. What shaped how you learn today?
