  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I still remember the first time I got truly stuck on a Rails bug in 2008. I sent a question to a mailing list and figured I might never hear back. An hour later, a stranger replied with a fix, an explanation, and a reminder to pay it forward. Before I knew it, I had met a total stranger and they were mentoring me. That was the vibe when I started: small, tight knit, and very collaborative.</p>

<p>Jump ahead a decade and the on ramp looks different. Fewer mailing lists. More bootcamps, YouTube, Discord, and Stack Overflow. Folks learn fast, ship fast, and get help in new places. Rails changed, but the bigger shift was how people came into the community and learned the craft.</p>

<p>That shift is what I think of as the Rails Generation Gap. We do not talk about it enough, and it matters.</p>

<p>I am starting a short series on this. I will look at the early craft culture, the bootcamp boom, the cultural shifts that came with it, and some practical ways to bridge the gap. The idea for this series was what I cam away from with the first Rails meetup I have been to in years, which I wrote about <a href="/general/meta/2025/09/08/welcome-to-my-blog/#what-brought-me-back">here</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="before-bootcamps-a-craft-culture">Before bootcamps: a craft culture</h2>

<p>When I started with Rails in 2008, it still felt like magic. Convention over configuration made things click. Getting started was not easy though. Docs were thin, posts were dense, and half the time you learned by reading the source.</p>

<p>The upside was depth. Those of us who came in during that era learned the how and the why. Mentorship was built in because it had to be.</p>

<p>It also felt closed at times. Fewer entry points. Less diversity. Sometimes it read like an insider club.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-bootcamp-boom">The bootcamp boom</h2>

<p>Around 2013, bootcamps exploded. Course Report counted roughly two thousand grads in 2013. By 2019, it was more than twenty three thousand a year, and Rails was everywhere in those programs.</p>

<p>Rails made sense for teaching. You could get someone to a working web app in weeks, not months. For career changers, that was huge.</p>

<p>More people in the community was a good thing. It opened doors beyond CS degrees and long nights reading code.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-gap">The gap</h2>

<p>Growth comes with tradeoffs. Some of the old guard saw bootcamp grads as folks who could ship but could not explain what Active Record was doing under the hood. Some newcomers saw veterans as unapproachable or stuck in old patterns.</p>

<p>The way we shared knowledge changed too. Long form posts and deep dives gave way to shorter answers and quick videos. Stack Overflow peaked around 2013 to 2015 and then slid. By 2023, new questions were down about seventy seven percent compared to 2009.</p>

<p>That shift in how we learn and teach created friction.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-it-still-matters">Why it still matters</h2>

<p>Rails is mature now. It is not the new hot thing. The gap still shows up in day to day work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiring and onboarding: I have seen teams struggle to bring on a lot of juniors without strong mentorship in place.</li>
  <li>Open source health: Rails thrives on contribution. Without context and a habit of paying it forward, it gets harder to sustain.</li>
  <li>Mixing voices: Veterans bring depth. New folks bring energy and fresh perspective. We need both.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether we talk to each other, or past each other, determines a lot about where Rails goes next.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="closing-the-gap">Closing the gap</h2>

<p>A few practical moves I have seen help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Veterans can share not just code, but the history and tradeoffs that shaped Rails.</li>
  <li>Bootcamp grads can document what they learn and pull others up the ladder behind them.</li>
  <li>Companies can try apprenticeship style onboarding and give seniors time to mentor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rails has always been more than code. Community is the multiplier. How we teach, share, and build will shape the next decade.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next</h2>

<p>This is the first post in a short series on the Rails Generation Gap. Next up, I will rewind to the early era of screencasts, whimsical guides, and in person mentorship, and pull forward the parts that still work today.</p>

<p>If you have lived through both sides of this, what differences have you noticed? How do you think we can build better bridges between generations of Rails developers?</p>
